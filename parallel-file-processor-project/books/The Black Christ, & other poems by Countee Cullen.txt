_To the Three for Whom the Book_


    Once like a lady
    In a silken dress,
    The serpent might eddy
    Through the wilderness,
    Billow and glow
    And undulate
    In a rustling flow
    Of sinuous hate.
    Now dull-eyed and leaden,
    Of having lost
    His Eden
    He pays the cost.
    He shuns the tree
    That brought him low
    As grown to be
    Domestic; no
    Temptations dapple,
    From leaf to root,
    The modern apple
    Our meekest fruit.
    Dragon and griffin
    And basilisk
    Whose stare could stiffen,
    And the hot breath whisk
    From the overbold
    Braving a gaze
    So freezing cold,
    Who sings their praise
    These latter days?
    That venemous head
    On a woman fair,--
    Medusa’s dead
    Of the hissing hair.
    No beasts are made
    Meet for the whir
    Of that sunken blade
    Excalibur.
    No smithies forge
    A shining sword
    Fit for the gorge
    Of a beast abhorred.
    Pale Theseus
    Would have no need,
    Were he with us,
    Of sword or thread;
    For long has been set
    The baleful star
    Of Pasiphaë’s pet,
    The Minotaur.
    Though they are dead,
    Those ancient ones,
    Each bestial head
    Dust under tons
    Of dust, new beasts
    Have come, their heirs,
    Claiming their feasts
    As the old did theirs.
    Clawless they claw,
    Fangless they rend;
    And the stony maw
    Crams on without end.
    Still are arrayed
    (But with brighter eyes)
    Stripling and maid
    For the sacrifice.
    We cannot spare
    This toll we pay
    Of the slender, the fair,
    The bright and the gay!
    Gold and black crown,
    Body slim and taut,
    How they go down
    ’Neath the juggernaut!
    Youth of the world,
    Like scythèd wheat,
    How they are hurled
    At the clay god’s feet!
    Hear them cry Holy
    To stone and to steel,
    See them bend lowly,
    Loyal and leal,
    Blood rendered and bone,
    To steel and to stone.
    They have forgot
    The stars and the sun,
    The grassy plot,
    And waters that run
    From rock to rock;--
    Their only care
    Is to grasp a lock
    Of Mammon’s hair.

    But you three rare
    Friends whom I love
    (With rhymes to swear
    The depths whereof)
    A book to you three
    Who have not bent
    The idolatrous knee,
    Nor worship lent
    To modern rites,
    Knowing full well
    How a just god smites
    The infidel;
    Three to whom Pan
    Is no mere myth,
    But a singing Man
    To be reckoned with;--
    Witness him now
    In the mist and dew;
    Lean and hear how
    He carols to you:
    “Gather as a flower
    Living to your heart;
    Let the full shower
    Rankle and smart;
    Youth is the coffer
    Where all is hid;
    All age may offer
    Youth can outbid.
    Blind with your beauty
    The ranks of scorn,
    Take for a duty
    Pleasure; you were born
    Joy to incur.
    Ere the eyes are misted
    With a rheumy blur,
    Ere the speech is twisted
    To a throaty slur,
    Ere the cheeks are haggard;
    Ere the prick of the spur
    Finds you lame or laggard,
    Do not demur!
    When Time advances
    Terrible and lone,
    Recall there were dances
    Though they be flown.
    When Death plys the riddle
    To which all are mute,
    Remember the fiddle,
    The lyre and the flute.”

    To three who will heed
    His song, nor brook
    That a god should plead
    In vain, a book.




_Tribute_

(To My Mother)


    Because man is not virtuous in himself,
    Nor kind, nor given to sweet charities,
    Save goaded by the little kindling elf
    Of some dear face it pleasures him to please;
    Some men who else were humbled to the dust,
    Have marveled that the chastening hand should stay,
    And never dreamed they held their lives in trust
    To one the victor loved a world away.
    So I, least noble of a churlish race,
    Least kind of those by nature rough and crude,
    Have at the intervention of your face
    Spared him with whom was my most bitter feud
    One moment, and the next, a deed more grand,
    The helpless fly imprisoned in my hand.




_That Bright Chimeric Beast_

(For Lynn Riggs)


    That bright chimeric beast
    Conceived yet never born,
    Save in the poet’s breast,
    The white-flanked unicorn,
    Never may be shaken
    From his solitude;
    Never may be taken
    In any earthly wood.

    That bird forever feathered,
    Of its new self the sire,
    After aeons weathered,
    Reincarnate by fire,
    Falcon may not nor eagle
    Swerve from his eerie,
    Nor any crumb inveigle
    Down to an earthly tree.

    That fish of the dread regime
    Invented to become
    The fable and the dream
    Of the Lord’s aquarium,
    Leviathan, the jointed
    Harpoon was never wrought
    By which the Lord’s anointed
    Will suffer to be caught.

    Bird of the deathless breast,
    Fish of the frantic fin,
    That bright chimeric beast
    Flashing the argent skin,--
    If beasts like these you’d harry,
    Plumb then the poet’s dream;
    Make it your aviary,
    Make it your wood and stream.
    There only shall the swish
    Be heard, of the regal fish;
    There like a golden knife
    Dart the feet of the unicorn,
    And there, death brought to life,
    The dead bird be reborn.




_At the Etoile_

(At the Unknown Soldier’s Grave in Paris)


    If in the lists of life he bore him well,
    Sat gracefully or fell unhorsed in love,
    No tongue is dowered now with speech to tell
    Since he and death somewhere matched glove with glove.

    What proud or humble union gave him birth,
    Not reckoning on this immortal bed,
    Is one more riddle that the cryptic earth
    Though knowing chooses to retain unsaid.

    Since he was weak as other men,--or like
    Young Galahad as fair in thought as limb,
    Each bit of moving dust in France may strike
    Its breast in pride, knowing he stands for him.

[Illustration]




_Two Epitaphs_


  1 For the Unknown Soldier (Paris)

    Unknown but not unhonored rest,
    Symbol of all Time shall not reap;
    Not one stilled heart in that torn breast,
    But a myriad millions sleep.


  2 For a Child Still-born

    Here sleeps a spark that never burned,
    A seed not granted spring to bloom,
    A soul whose darkened pathway turned
    From tomb of flesh to dusty tomb.




_To an Unknown Poet_


    “Love is enough,” I read somewhere;
    Lines some poor poet in his pride
    And poverty wrote on the air
    To ease his heart, and soothe his bride.

    Something in me, child of an age
    Cold to the core, undeified,
    Warmed to my brother bard, this sage;
    And I too leaned upon my pride.

    But pride I found can blind our eyes,
    And poverty is worse than pride.
    Love’s breed from both is a nest of lies;
    And singer of sweet songs, you lied.




_Little Sonnet to Little Friends_


    Let not the proud of heart condemn
    Me that I mould my ways to hers,
    Groping for healing in a hem
    No wind of passion ever stirs;
    Nor let them sweetly pity me
    When I am out of sound and sight;
    They waste their time and energy;
    No mares encumber me at night.

    Always a trifle fond and strange,
    And some have said a bit bizarre,
    Say, “Here’s the sun,” I would not change
    It for my dead and burnt-out star.
    Shine as it will, I have no doubt
    Some day the sun, too, may go out.




_Mood_


    I think an impulse stronger than my mind
    May some day grasp a knife, unloose a vial,
    Or with a little leaden ball unbind
    The cords that tie me to the rank and file.
    My hands grow quarrelsome with bitterness,
    And darkly bent upon the final fray;
    Night with its stars upon a grave seems less
    Indecent than the too complacent day.

    God knows I would be kind, let live, speak fair,
    Requite an honest debt with more than just,
    And love for Christ’s dear sake these shapes that wear
    A pride that had its genesis in dust,--
    The meek are promised much in a book I know
    But one grows weary turning cheek to blow.




_Counter Mood_


    Let this be scattered far and wide, laid low
    Upon the waters as they fall and rise,
    Be caught and carried by the winds that blow,
    Nor let it be arrested by the skies:
    I who am mortal say I shall not die;
    I who am dust of this am positive,
    That though my nights tend toward the grave, yet I
    Shall on some brighter day arise, and live.

    Ask me not how I am oracular,
    Nor whence this arrogant assurance springs.
    Ask rather Faith the canny conjurer,
    (Who while your reason mocks him mystifies
    Winning the grudging plaudits of your eyes)--
    How suddenly the supine egg has wings.




_The Wind and the Weather_


    Forever shall not burn his tongue
      So glibly after this;
    Eternity was brief that hung
      Upon a passing kiss.

    A year ago no metaphor
      Was rich enough to trace
    A single figure boasting more
      Allurement than her face.

    One spring from then, small change we find
      In him; she still is fair.
    But in the other’s heart or mind
      Neither glows anywhere.




_In the Midst of Life_


    Bud bursting from a tomb
    Of dust, this mortal knows
    In winter’s sterile womb
    For your despoiling grows
    What comes to every rose.

    Grass so securely green,
    Sky-climbing corn so tall,
    Know in your length is seen
    What overtowers all:
    The shadow of the fall.

    Yet blossoms with each spring
    Reopen; grasses sprout;
    And jaunty corn stalks fling
    New skeins of silk about.
    Nature is skilled to rout

    Death’s every ambuscade;
    For man alone is poured
    The potion once essayed
    That sharper than a sword
    Destroys both mouth and gourd.

    Deplore, lament, bewail;
    The sword seeks out the sheath;
    Though all things else may fail,
    Two things keep faith; this breath
    A while; and longer death.




_Minutely Hurt_


    Since I was minutely hurt,
    Giant griefs and woes
    Only find me staunchly girt
    Against all other blows.

    Once an atom cracks the heart
    All is done and said;
    Poison, steel, and fiery dart
    May then be buffeted.

[Illustration]




_Never the Final Stone_


    Though by the glory of your lady’s face
    The riots of the sun and moon are quelled,
    Yet have the hands that fashioned her some grace
    Whereto perfection was allied, withheld.

    The perfect wooer never speaks the word
    The object of his passion most would hear;
    So does expectance keep her wild feet spurred
    Toward that which ever is no more than near.

    And daily from His lonely mountain-top,
    God sees us rear our Babels on the plain;
    Then with one stone to go, He lets us drop
    That we may want and strive for Him again.




_Light Lady_


    They say when virtue slipped from her,
    Awakened by her fall,
    Sin seemed to work a miracle
    And made her soul grow tall.

    Here with her penny papers by,
    We see how well she diced:
    Nothing to do but munch her gums
    And sing the love of Christ.

    And now with alms for what she was
    Men stroke her ragged fur;
    When Death comes down this street, his face
    Will not be strange to her.

[Illustration]




_By Their Fruits_


    I know a lover when I see one,
    And I can tell the way they fare:
    If those they dote on shed some sun,
    Or blow a cool and languid air.

    Those that are loved, though niggardly,
    Move with a lively foot and eye;
    The others drag like men who see
    Their day and minute set to die.




_A Miracle Demanded_


    This life is like a tree that flourisheth
    With fruit and flower, gay leaf and sprouting twig;
    But pestilence is in the wind’s warm breath,
    And at the roots the worms and mice grow big.
    The gardener, steady in his anxious claims,
    Who prunes for love, he says, and not for wage,
    Than simple care has more disastrous names,
    The most elect: Disease, Death, and Old Age.

    Against such foes how shall a tree prevail
    To curb its consummation in decay,
    And like a tree shall men not strive and fail,
    Unless all wonders have not passed away?
    Renew an ancient vision, Lord, in me:
    Open the young man’s eyes that he may see.




_Tongue-tied_


    You ask me why I love her, and you pause
    Magnanimous, that I may make reply
    Handing you deftly parceled every cause,
    Saying with confidence, “Lo, this is why.”
    But I am mute as if I had no tongue,
    Without reason as if I had no mind,
    This song the most familiar ever sung,
    Is lost to me like a leaf caught in the wind.

    And so my tongue is tied; and so you smile
    Not knowing, little lover that you are,
    (Prattling, “’Twill wear, ’twill last so long a while”)
    The poet is compelled to love his star,
    Not knowing he could never tell you why
    Though silence makes inadequate reply.




_Ultima Verba_


    Not being in my coffin, yet I know
    What suffocations crowd their breath who go
    Through some mischance alive into the grave;
    Not having any wound at all to shout
    Belief to Thomas who must see or doubt,
    I feel my life blood ebbing wave on wave.

    And yet this knowledge cannot summon strength
    To rend apart the life-impaling length
    Of these strong boards that hold my body down;
    There is no cloth, no cool and radiant stuff
    (Save fashioned by your hand) healing enough
    To staunch this thin red flow in which I drown.

    I am as one knowing what day he dies,
    Who looks in vain for mercy into eyes
    No glints of pity shade, no pardons stir,
    And thinks, “Although the trap by which I span
    This world and that another springs, this man
    Is both my judge and executioner.”




_The Foolish Heart_


    “Be still, heart, cease those measured strokes;
    Lie quiet in your hollow bed;
    This moving frame is but a hoax
    To make you think you are not dead.”

    Thus spake I to my body’s slave,
    With beats still to be answerèd;
    Poor foolish heart that needs a grave
    To prove to it that it is dead.

[Illustration]




_A Wish_


    I hope when I have sung my rounds
    Of song, I shall have strength to slay
    The wish to chirp on any grounds,
    Content that silence hold her sway,
    My tongue not rolling futile sounds
    After my heart has had its say.




_For Helen Keller_


    Against our puny sound and sight
    In vain the bells of Heaven ring,
    The Mystic Blossoms red and white
    May not intrigue our visioning.

    For lest we handle, lest we touch,
    Lest carnally our minds condone,
    Our clumsy credence may not clutch
    The under or the overtone.

    Her finer alchemy converts
    The clanging brass to golden-pealed,
    And for her sight the black earth spurts
    Hues never thought there unrevealed.




_Asked and Answered_


    How have I found this favor in your sight,
    And will the flame burn steady to the end,
    Until we pass that dark and dangerous bend
    Where there is such a crying need for light;
    Or will it flare up now, flame-clear and bright,
    Sun-like its wealth so far and wide distend
    That nothing will remain for us to spend
    When toll is taken of the dismal night?

    Why should I harrow up my mind like this
    To tarnish with a doubt each golden kiss?
    This is the Day most certainly. This bars
    Us now from any hidden darkness spun.
    Sufficient to the day let be the sun,
    And to the night the spear-points of the stars.




_Two Poets_


  1

    “The love-mad lark you sing of swooned,” they said,
    “And speared his bosom on a thorn of last
    Year’s rose; cease playing Orpheus; no blast
    You blow can raise Eurydice once dead.
    Our ears are cloyed with songs our fathers heard
    Of how your lady’s face and form were fair;
    Put by your fluting; swell a martial air,
    And spur us on with some prophetic word.”

    So, wearying, he changed his tune, and won
    The praise of little men (who needed none) ...
    But oh to see him smile as when dawn blew
    A trumpet only he could hear, and dew
    He could not brush away besieged his eyes
    At sight of gulls departing from his skies.


  2

    “How could a woman love him; love, or wed?”
    And thinking only of his tuneless face
    And arms that held no hint of skill or grace,
    They shook a slow, commiserative head
    To see him amble by; but still they fed
    Their wilting hearts on his, were fired to race
    Once more, and panting at life’s deadly pace,
    They drank as wine the blood-in-song he shed.

    Yet in the dream-walled room where last he lay,
    Soft garments gathered dust all night and day,
    As women whom he loved and sang of came
    To smooth his brow and wail a secret name.
    A rose placed in his hand by Guinevere
    Was drenched with Magdalen’s eternal tear.




_Not Sacco and Vanzetti_


    These men who do not die, but send to death,
    These iron men whom mercy cannot bend
    Beyond the lettered law; what when their breath
    Shall suddenly and naturally end?
    What shall their final retribution be,
    What bloody silver then shall pay the tolls
    Exacted for this legal infamy
    When death indicts their stark immortal souls?

    The day a slumbering but awful God,
    Before Time to Eternity is blown,
    Examines with the same unyielding rod
    These images of His with hearts of stone,
    These men who do not die, but death decree,--
    These are the men I should not care to be.




_A Song No Gentleman Would Sing to Any Lady_


    There were some things I might not know
    Had you not pedagogued me so;
    And these I thank you for;
    Now never shall a piquant face
    Cause my tutored heart a trace
    Of anguish any more.

    Before your pleasure made me wise
    A simulacrum of disguise
    Masked the serpent and the dove;
    That I discern now hiss from coo,
    My heart’s full gratitude to you,
    Lady I had learned to love.

    Before I knew love well I sang
    Many a polished pain and pang
    With proper bardic zeal;
    But now I know hearts do not break
    So easily, and though a snake
    Has made them, wounds may heal.




_Self Criticism_


    Shall I go all my bright days singing,
    (A little pallid, a trifle wan)
    The failing note still vainly clinging
    To the throat of the stricken swan?

    Shall I never feel and meet the urge
    To bugle out beyond my sense
    That the fittest song of earth is a dirge,
    And only fools trust Providence?

    Than this better the reed never turned flute,
    Better than this no song,
    Better a stony silence, better a mute
    Mouth and a cloven tongue.




_A Thorn Forever in the Breast_


    A hungry cancer will not let him rest
    Whose heart is loyal to the least of dreams;
    There is a thorn forever in his breast
    Who cannot take his world for what it seems;
    Aloof and lonely must he ever walk,
    Plying a strange and unaccustomed tongue,
    An alien to the daily round of talk,
    Mute when the sordid songs of earth are sung.

    This is the certain end his dream achieves:
    He sweats his blood and prayers while others sleep,
    And shoulders his own coffin up a steep
    Immortal mountain, there to meet his doom
    Between two wretched dying men, of whom
    One doubts, and one for pity’s sake believes.




_The Proud Heart_


    That lively organ, palpitant and red,
    Enrubied in the staid and sober breast,
    Telling the living man, “You are not dead
    Until this hammered anvil takes its rest,”
    My life’s timepiece wound to alarm some day
    The body to its need of box and shroud,
    Was meant till then to beat one haughty way;
    A crimson stroke should be no less than proud.

    Yet this high citadel has come to grief,
    Been broken as an arrow drops its bird,
    Splintered as many ways as veins in a leaf
    At a woman’s laugh or a man’s harsh word;
    But being proud still strikes its hours in pain;
    The dead man lives, and none perceives him slain.




_Interlude_

[Illustration]




_The Simple Truth_


    I know of all the words I speak or write,
    Precious and woven of a vibrant sound,
    None ever snares your faith, intrigues you quite,
    Or sends you soaring from the solid ground.
    You are the level-headed lover who
    Can match my fever while the kisses last,
    But you are never shaken through and through;
    Your roots are firm after the storm has passed.

    I shall know nights of tossing in my sleep
    Fondling a hollow where a head should lie;
    But you a calm review, no tears to weep,
    No wounds to dress, no futile breaths to sigh.
    Ever this was the way of wind with flame:
    To harry it, then leave swift as it came.




_Therefore, Adieu_


    Now you are gone, and with your unreturning goes
    All I had thought in spite of you would stay;
    Now draws forever to its unawakening close
    The beauty of the bright bandanna’d day.

    Now sift in ombrous flakes and revolutions slow
    My dreams descending from my heady sky.
    The balm I kept to cool my grief in (leaves of snow)
    Now melts, with your departure flowing by.

    I knew, indeed, the straight unswerving track the sun
    Took to your face (as other ecstasies)
    Yet I had thought some faith to me in them; they run
    From me to you as fly to honey, bees.

    Avid, to leave me neither fevered joy nor ache,
    Only of soul and body vast unrest.
    Sun, moon, and stars should be enough; why must you take
    The feeling of the heart out of the breast?

    Now I who dreamed before I died to shoot one shaft
    Of courage from a warped and crooked bow,
    Stand utterly forsaken, stripped of that small craft
    I had, watching with you all prowess go.




_At a Parting_


    Let us not turn for this aside to die,
    Crying a lover may not be a friend.
    Our grief is vast enough without that lie;
    All stories may not boast a happy end.
    Love was a flower, sweet, and flowers fade;
    Love was a fairy tale; these have their close.
    The endless chronicle was never made,
    Nor, save in dreams, the ever-scented rose.

    Seeing them dim in passion’s diadem,
    Our rubies that were bright that now are dull,
    Let them not fade without their requiem,
    How they were red one time and beautiful,
    And how the heart where once a ruby bled
    May live, yet bear that mark till it is dead.




_Dictum_


    Yea, I have put thee from me utterly,
    And they who plead thy cause do plead in vain;
    Window and door are bolted, never key
    From any ore shall cozen them again.
    This is my regal justice: banishment,
    That those who please me now may read and see
    How self-sustained I am, with what content
    I thrive alike on love or treachery.

    God, Thou hast Christ, they say, at Thy right hand;
    Close by Thy left Michael is straight and leal;
    Around Thy throne the chanting elders stand,
    And on the earth Thy feudal millions kneel.
    Criest Thou never, Lord, above their song:
    “But Lucifer was tall, his wings were long?”




_Revelation_


    Pity me, I said;
    But you cried, Pity you;
    And suddenly I saw
    Higher than my own grief grew.
    I saw a tree of woe so tall,
    So deeply boughed with grief,
    That matched with it my bitter plant
    Was dwarfed into a leaf.

[Illustration]




_Bright Bindings_


    Your love to me was like an unread book,
    Bright-backed, with smooth white pages yet unslit;
    Fondly as a lover, foolishly, I took
    It from its shelf one day and opened it.
    Here shall I read, I thought, beauty and grace,
    The soul’s most high and awful poetry:--
    Alas for lovers and the faith they place
    In love, alas for you, alas for me.

    I have but read a page or two at most,
    The most my horror-blinded eyes may read.
    I find here but a windy tapering ghost
    Where I sought flesh gifted to ache and bleed.
    Yet back you go, though counterfeit you be.
    I love bright books even when they fail me.




_Ghosts_


    Breast under breast when you shall lie
      With him who in my place
    Bends over you with flashing eye
      And ever nearing face;

    Hand fast in hand when you shall tread
      With him the springing ways
    Of love from me inherited
      After my little phase;

    Be not surprised if suddenly
      The couch or air confound
    Your ravished ears upbraidingly,
      And silence turn to sound.

    But never let it trouble you,
      Or cost you one caress;
    Ghosts are soon sent with a word or two
      Back to their loneliness.




_Song in Spite of Myself_


    Never love with all your heart,
      It only ends in aching;
    And bit by bit to the smallest part
      That organ will be breaking.

    Never love with all your mind,
      It only ends in fretting;
    In musing on sweet joys behind,
      Too poignant for forgetting.

    Never love with all your soul,
      For such there is no ending,
    Though a mind that frets may find control,
      And a shattered heart find mending.

    Give but a grain of the heart’s rich seed,
      Confine some under cover,
    And when love goes, bid him God-speed,
      And find another lover.




_Nothing Endures_


    Nothing endures,
    Not even love,
    Though the warm heart purrs
    Of the length thereof.

    Though beauty wax,
    Yet shall it wane;
    Time lays a tax
    On the subtlest brain.

    Let the blood riot,
    Give it its will;
    It shall grow quiet,
    It shall grow still.

    Nirvana gapes
    For all things given;
    Nothing escapes,
    Love not even.




_There Must Be Words_


    This wound will be effaced as others have,
    This scar recede into oblivion,
    Leaving the skin immaculate and suave,
    With none to guess the thing they gaze upon.
    After a decent show of mourning I,
    As once I ever was, shall be as free
    To look on love with calm unfaltering eye,
    And marvel that such fools as lovers be.

    These are brave words from one who like a child
    Cuts dazzling arabesques on summer ice
    That, kissed by sun, begins to crack and thaw;
    The old assurance dies, only the wild
    Desire to live goes on; any device
    Compels its frantic grasp, even a straw.




_One Day I Told My Love_


    One day I told my love my heart,
      Disclosed it out and in;
    I let her read the ill-writ chart
      Small with virtue, big with sin.

    I took it from the hidden socket
      Where it was wont to grieve;
    “I’ll turn it,” I said, “into a locket,
      Or a bright band for your sleeve.”

    I let her hold the naked thing
      No one had seen before;
    And had she willed, her hand might wring
      It dry and drop it to the floor.

    It was a gentle thing she did,
      The wisest and the best;
    “The proper place for a heart,” she said,
      “Is back in the sheltering breast.”




_Lesson_


    I lay in silence at her side,
      My heart’s and spirit’s choice;
    For we had said harsh things and cried
      On love in a bitter voice.

    We lay and watched two points in space,
      Pricked in heaven, faint and far.
    They seemed so near, but who could trace
      That width between star and star?

    We lay and watched, and suddenly
      There was a streak of light,
    And where were two, the eye might see
      But one star in the night.

    My hand stole out, her hand crept near,
      Grief was a splintered spar;
    Two fused in one there, did you hear
      Us claiming kinship, star?

_The Street Called Crooked_

(Le Havre, August 1928)


    “_Bon soir, monsieur_,” they called to me;
      And, “_Venez voir nos femmes._”
    “_Bon soir, mesdames_,” they got from me,
      And, “_J’ai une meilleure dame._”

    “To meet strange lips and foreign eyes
      I did not cross the foam,
    I have a dearer, fairer prize
      Who waits for me at home.”

    “Her eyes are browner, lips more red
      Than any lady’s light;
    ’Twould grieve her heart and droop her head
      If I failed her tonight.”

    “_Bon soir, mesdames; que Dieu vous garde_;
      And catch this coin I throw;
    The ways of life are bleak and hard,
      Ladies, I think you know.”

    A bright and crooked street it gleamed
      With light and laughter filled;
    All night the warm wine frothed and streamed
      While souls were stripped and killed.




_The Law That Changeth Not_


    Stern legislation of a Persian hand
    Upon my heart, Love, strict Medean writ,
    Must till the end of time and me command
    Obeisance from him who fostered it.
    All other codes may hide their littlest flaw
    Toward which the hopeful prisoner may kneel;
    I come of those who once they write a law
    Do barricade themselves against appeal.

    So stand I now condemned by mine own tort;
    Extenuations? There is none to plead.
    I am my own most ultimate resort;
    There is no pardon for the stricken Mede.
    I turn to go, half valiant, half absurd,
    To perish on a promise, die on a word.




_Valedictory_


    No word upon the boarded page
    That once in praise I spoke,
    Would I in bitterness and rage,
    Had I the power, revoke.
    Take them and bind them to your heart,
    With ribbon or with rue.
    An end arrives to all we start;
    I write no more of you.

    Go then, adhere to the vows you make
    Out of a haughty heart;
    No more to tremble for my sake
    Nor writhe beneath the smart
    Of hearing on an alien tongue
    Tolled lightly and in play,
    The bell by which our lives were rung,
    The bell we break today.

    Love ever was the brightest dream
    My pen might seize upon;
    Think not I shall renounce the theme
    Now that the dream is done.
    We are put by, but not the Bow,
    The Arrows, and the Dove.
    Though you and I go down, still glow
    The armaments of love.

    The essence shines devoid of form,
    Passion plucked of its sting,
    The Holy Rose that hides no worm,
    The Everlasting Thing.
    Though loud I cry on Venus’ name
    To heal me and subdue
    The rising tide, the raging flame,
    I write no more of you.

    Rare was the poem we began
    (We called it that!) to live,
    And for a while the measures ran
    With all the heart could give.
    But, oh, the golden vein was thin,
    Early the dark cock crew;
    The heart cried out (love’s muezzin):
    I write no more of you.




_Color_




_To Certain Critics_


    Then call me traitor if you must,
    Shout treason and default!
    Say I betray a sacred trust
    Aching beyond this vault.
    I’ll bear your censure as your praise,
    For never shall the clan
    Confine my singing to its ways
    Beyond the ways of man.

    No racial option narrows grief,
    Pain is no patriot,
    And sorrow plaits her dismal leaf
    For all as lief as not.
    With blind sheep groping every hill,
    Searching an oriflamme,
    How shall the shepherd heart then thrill
    To only the darker lamb?




_Black Majesty_

(After reading John W. Vandercook’s chronicle of sable glory)


    These men were kings, albeit they were black,
    Christophe and Dessalines and L’Ouverture;
    Their majesty has made me turn my back
    Upon a plaint I once shaped to endure.
    These men were black, I say, but they were crowned
    And purple-clad, however brief their time.
    Stifle your agony; let grief be drowned;
    We know joy had a day once and a clime.

    Dark gutter-snipe, black sprawler-in-the-mud,
    A thing men did a man may do again.
    What answer filters through your sluggish blood
    To these dark ghosts who knew so bright a reign?
    “Lo, I am dark, but comely,” Sheba sings.
    “And we were black,” three shades reply, “but kings.”

[Illustration]




_Song of Praise_


    Who lies with his milk-white maiden,
    Bound in the length of her pale gold hair,
    Cooled by her lips with the cold kiss laden,
    He lies, but he loves not there.

    Who lies with his nut-brown maiden,
    Bruised to the bone by her sin-black hair,
    Warmed with the wine that her full lips trade in,
    He lies, and his love lies there.

_The Black Christ_

(_Hopefully dedicated to White America_)




_The Black Christ_


  1

    God’s glory and my country’s shame,
    And how one man who cursed Christ’s name
    May never fully expiate
    That crime till at the Blessed Gate
    Of Heaven He meet and pardon me
    Out of His love and charity;
    How God, who needs no man’s applause,
    For love of my stark soul, of flaws
    Composed, seeing it slip, did stoop
    Down to the mire and pick me up,
    And in the hollow of His hand
    Enact again at my command
    The world’s supremest tragedy,
    Until I die my burthen be;
    How Calvary in Palestine,
    Extending down to me and mine,
    Was but the first leaf in a line
    Of trees on which a Man should swing
    World without end, in suffering
    For all men’s healing, let me sing.

    O world grown indolent and crass,
    I stand upon your bleak morass
    Of incredulity and cry
    Your lack of faith is but a lie.
    If you but brushed the scales apart
    That cloud your eyes and clinch your heart
    There is no telling what grace might
    Be leveled to your clearer sight;
    Nor what stupendous choir break
    Upon your soul till you should ache
    (If you but let your fingers veer,
    And raised to heaven a listening ear)
    In utter pain in every limb
    To know and sing as they that hymn.
    If men would set their lips to prayer
    With that delight with which they swear,
    Heaven and earth as bow and string,
    Would meet, would be attuned and sing.

    We are diseased, trunk, branch, and shoot;
    A sickness gathers at the root
    Of us. We flaunt a gaudy fruit
    But maggots wrangle at the core.
    We cry for angels; yet wherefore,
    Who raise no Jacobs any more?...
    No men with eyes quick to perceive
    The Shining Thing, clutch at its sleeve,
    Against the strength of Heaven try
    The valiant force of men who die;--
    With heaving heart where courage sings
    Strive with a mist of Light and Wings,
    And wrestle all night long, though pressed
    Be rib to rib and back to breast,
    Till in the end the lofty guest
    Pant, “Conquering human, be thou blest.”

    As once they stood white-plumed and still,
    All unobserved on Dothan’s hill,
    Now, too, the angels, stride for stride,
    Would march with us, but are denied.
    Did we but let our credence sprout
    As we do mockery and doubt,
    Lord Christ Himself would stand revealed
    In every barren, frosty field
    That we misname the heart. Belief
    In something more than pain and grief,
    In only earth’s most commonplace,
    Might yet illumine every face
    Of wretchedness, every blinded eye,
    If from the hermitage where nigh
    These thousand years the world of men
    Has hemmed her in, might come again
    With gracious eyes and gentle breath
    The still unconquered Lady, Faith.

    _Two brothers have I had on earth,
    One of spirit, one of sod;
    My mother suckled one at birth,
    One was the Son of God._

    Since that befell which came to me,
    Since I was singled out to be,
    Upon a wheel of mockery,
    The pattern of a new faith spun;
    I never doubt that once the sun
    For respite stopped in Gibeon,
    Or that a Man I could not know
    Two thousand ageless years ago,
    To shape my profit by His loss,
    Bought my redemption on a cross.

    “Now spring that heals the wounds of earth
    Is being born; and in her birth
    The wounds of men may find a cure.
    By such a thought I may endure,
    And of some things be no less sure.
    This is a cruel land, this South,
    And bitter words to twist my mouth,
    Burning my tongue down to its root,
    Were easily found; but I am mute
    Before the wonder of this thing:
    That God should send so pure a spring,
    Such grass to grow, such birds to sing,
    And such small trees bravely to sprout
    With timid leaves first coming out.
    A land spring yearly levies on
    Is gifted with God’s benison.
    The very odor of the loam
    Fetters me here to this, my home.
    The whitest lady in the town
    Yonder trailing a silken gown
    Is less kin to this dirt than I.
    Rich mistresses with proud heads high
    This dirt and I are one to them;
    They flick us both from the bordered hem
    Of lovely garments we supply;
    But I and the dirt see just as high
    As any lady cantering by.
    Why should I cut this bond, my son,
    This tie too taut to be undone?
    This ground and I are we not one?
    Has it not birthed and grown and fed me:
    Yea, if you will, and also bled me?
    That little patch of wizened corn
    Aching and straining to be born,
    May render back at some small rate
    The blood and bone of me it ate.
    The weevil there that rends apart
    My cotton also tears my heart.
    Here too, your father, lean and black,
    Paid court to me with all the knack
    Of any dandy in the town,
    And here were born, and here have grown,
    His sons and mine, as lean and black.
    What ghosts there are in this old shack
    Of births and deaths, soft times and hard!
    I count it little being barred
    From those who undervalue me.
    I have my own soul’s ecstasy.
    Men may not bind the summer sea,
    Nor set a limit to the stars;
    The sun seeps through all iron bars;
    The moon is ever manifest.
    These things my heart always possessed.
    And more than this (and here’s the crown)
    No man, my son, can batter down
    The star-flung ramparts of the mind.
    So much for flesh; I am resigned,
    Whom God has made shall He not guide?”

    [Illustration]

    So spake my mother, and her pride
    For one small minute in its tide
    Bore all my bitterness away.
    I saw the thin bent form, the gray
    Hair shadowed in the candlelight,
    The eyes fast parting with their sight,
    The rough, brown fingers, lean with toil,
    Marking her kinship to the soil.
    Year crowding year, after the death
    Of that one man whose last drawn breath
    Had been the gasping of her name,
    She had wrought on, lit with some flame
    Her children sensed, but could not see,
    And with a patient wizardry
    Wheedled her stubborn bit of land
    To yield beneath her coaxing hand,
    And sometimes in a lavish hour
    To blossom even with a flower.
    Time after time her eyes grew dim
    Watching a life pay for the whim
    Some master of the land must feed
    To keep her people down. The seed
    They planted in her children’s breasts
    Of hatred toward these men like beasts
    She weeded out with legends how
    Once there had been somewhere as now
    A people harried, low in the dust;
    But such had been their utter trust
    In Heaven and its field of stars
    That they had broken down their bars,
    And walked across a parted sea
    Praising His name who set them free.
    I think more than the tales she told,
    The music in her voice, the gold
    And mellow notes she wrought,
    Made us forbear to voice the thought
    Low-buried underneath our love,
    That we saw things she knew not of.
    We had no scales upon our eyes;
    God, if He was, kept to His skies,
    And left us to our enemies.
    Often at night fresh from our knees
    And sorely doubted litanies
    We grappled for the mysteries:
    “We never seem to reach nowhere,”
    Jim with a puzzled, questioning air,
    Would kick the covers back and stare
    For me the elder to explain.
    As like as not, my sole refrain
    Would be, “A man was lynched last night.”
    “Why?” Jim would ask, his eyes star-bright.
    “A white man struck him; he showed fight.
    Maybe God thinks such things are right.”
    “Maybe God never thinks at all--
    Of us,” and Jim would clench his small,
    Hard fingers tight into a ball.

    “Likely there ain’t no God at all,”
    Jim was the first to clothe a doubt
    With words, that long had tried to sprout
    Against our wills and love of one
    Whose faith was like a blazing sun
    Set in a dark, rebellious sky.
    Now then the roots were fast, and I
    Must nurture them in her despite.
    God could not be, if He deemed right,
    The grief that ever met our sight.

    Jim grew; a brooder, silent, sheathed;
    But pride was in the air he breathed;
    Inside you knew an Ætna seethed.
    Often when some new holocaust
    Had come to undermine and blast
    The life of some poor wretch we knew,
    His bones would show like white scars through
    His fists in anger’s futile way.
    “I have a fear,” he used to say,
    “This thing may come to me some day.
    Some man contemptuous of my race
    And its lost rights in this hard place,
    Will strike me down for being black.
    But when I answer I’ll pay back
    The late revenge long overdue
    A thousand of my kind and hue.
    A thousand black men, long since gone
    Will guide my hand, stiffen the brawn,
    And speed one life-divesting blow
    Into some granite face of snow.
    And I may swing, but not before
    I send some pale ambassador
    Hot footing it to hell to say
    A proud black man is on his way.”

    When such hot venom curled his lips
    And anger snapped like sudden whips
    Of lightning in his eyes, her words,--
    Slow, gentle as the fall of birds
    That having strained to win aloft
    Spread out their wings and slowly waft
    Regretfully back to the earth,--
    Would challenge him to name the worth
    Contained in any seed of hate.
    Ever the same soft words would mate
    Upon her lips: love, trust, and wait.
    But he, young, quick, and passionate,
    Could not so readily conceal,
    Deeper than acid-burns, or steel
    Inflicted wounds, his vital hurt;
    So still the bitter phrase would spurt:
    “The things I’ve seen, the things I see,
    Show what my neighbor thinks of me.
    The world is large enough for two
    Men any time, of any hue.
    I give pale men a wide berth ever;
    Best not to meet them, for I never
    Could bend my spirit, never truckle
    To them; my blood’s too hot to knuckle.”

    And true; the neighbors spoke of him
    As that proud nigger, handsome Jim.
    It was a grudging compliment,
    Half paid in jest, half fair intent,
    By those whose partial, jaundiced eye
    Saw each of us as one more fly,
    Or one more bug the summer brings,
    All shaped alike; antennæ, wings,
    And noxious all; if caught, to die.
    But Jim was not just one more fly,
    For he was handsome in a way
    Night is after a long, hot day.
    If blood flows on from heart to heart,
    And strong men leave their counterpart
    In vice and virtue in their seed,
    Jim’s bearing spoke his imperial breed.
    I was an offshoot, crude, inclined
    More to the earth; he was the kind
    Whose every graceful movement said,
    As blood must say, by turn of head,
    By twist of wrist, and glance of eye,
    “Good blood flows here, and it runs high.”
    He had an ease of limb, a raw,
    Clean, hilly stride that women saw
    With quickened throbbings of the breast.
    There was a show of wings; the nest
    Was too confined; Jim needed space
    To loop and dip and interlace;
    For he had passed the stripling stage,
    And stood a man, ripe for the wage
    A man extorts of life; his gage
    Was down. The beauty of the year
    Was on him now, and somewhere near
    By in the woods, as like as not,
    His cares were laid away, forgot
    In hearty wonderment and praise
    Of one of spring’s all perfect days.

    [Illustration]

    But in my heart a shadow walked
    At beauty’s side; a terror stalked
    For prey this loveliness of time.
    A curse lay on this land and clime.
    For all my mother’s love of it,
    Prosperity could not be writ
    In any book of destiny
    For this most red epitome
    Of man’s consistent cruelty
    To man. Corruption, blight, and rust
    Were its reward, and canker must
    Set in. There were too many ghosts
    Upon its lanes, too many hosts
    Of dangling bodies in the wind,
    Too many voices, choked and thinned,
    Beseeching mercy on its air.
    And like the sea set in my ear
    Ever there surged the steady fear
    Lest this same end and brutal fate
    March toward my proud, importunate
    Young brother. Often he’d say,
    “’Twere best, I think, we moved away.”
    But custom and an unseen hand
    Compelled allegiance to this land
    In her, and she by staying nailed
    Us there, by love securely jailed.

    But love and fear must end their bout,
    And one or both be counted out.
    Rebellion barked now like a gun;
    Like a split dam, this faith in one
    Who in my sight had never done
    One extraordinary thing
    That I should praise his name, or sing
    His bounty and his grace, let loose
    The pent-up torrent of abuse
    That clamored in me for release:
    “Nay, I have done with deities
    Who keep me ever on my knees,
    My mouth forever in a tune
    Of praise, yet never grant the boon
    Of what I pray for night and day.
    God is a toy; put Him away.
    Or make you one of wood or stone
    That you can call your very own,
    A thing to feel and touch and stroke,
    Who does not break you with a yoke
    Of iron that he whispers soft;
    Nor promise you fine things aloft
    While back and belly here go bare,
    While His own image walks so spare
    And finds this life so hard to live
    You doubt that He has aught to give.
    Better an idol shaped of clay
    Near you, than one so far away.
    Although it may not heed your labors,
    At least it will not mind your neighbors’.
    ‘In His own time, He will unfold
    You milk and honey, streets of gold,
    High walls of jasper ...’ phrases rolled
    Upon the tongues of idiots.
    What profit _then_, if hunger gluts
    Us _now_? Better my God should be
    This moving, breathing frame of me,
    Strong hands and feet, live heart and eyes;
    And when these cease, say then God dies.
    Your God is somewhere worlds away
    Hunting a star He shot astray;
    Oh, He has weightier things to do
    Than lavish time on me and you.
    What thought has He of us, three motes
    Of breath, three scattered notes
    In His grand symphony, the world?
    Once we were blown, once we were hurled
    In place, we were as soon forgot.
    He might not linger on one dot
    When there were bars and staves to fling
    About, for waiting stars to sing.
    When Rome was a suckling, when Greece was young,
    Then there were Gods fit to be sung,
    Who paid the loyal devotee
    For service rendered zealously,
    In coin a man might feel and spend,
    Not marked ‘Deferred to Journey’s End.’
    The servant then was worth his hire;
    He went unscathed through flood and fire;
    Gods were a thing then to admire.
    ‘Bow down and worship us,’ they said.
    ‘You shall be clothed, be housed and fed,
    While yet you live, not when you’re dead.
    Strong are our arms where yours are weak.
    On them that harm you will we wreak
    The vengeance of a God though they
    Were Gods like us in every way.
    Not merely is an honor laid
    On those we touch with our accolade;
    We strike for you with that same blade!’”
    My mother shook a weary head--
    “Visions are not for all,” she said,
    “There were no risings from the dead,
    No frightened quiverings of earth
    To mark my spirit’s latter birth.
    The light that on Damascus’ road
    Blinded a scoffer never glowed
    For me. I had no need to view
    His side, or pass my fingers through
    Christ’s wounds. It breaks like that on some,
    And yet it can as surely come
    Without the lightning and the rain.
    Some who must have their hurricane
    Go stumbling through it for a light
    They never find. Only the night
    Of doubt is opened to their sight.
    They weigh and measure, search, define,--
    But he who seeks a thing divine
    Must humbly lay his lore aside,
    And like a child believe; confide
    In Him whose ways are deep and dark,
    And in the end perhaps the spark
    He sought will be revealed. Perchance
    Some things are hard to countenance,
    And others difficult to probe;
    But shall the mind that grew this globe,
    And out of chaos thought a world,
    To us be totally unfurled?
    And all we fail to comprehend,
    Shall such a mind be asked to bend
    Down to, unravel, and untwine?
    If those who highest hold His sign,
    Who praise Him most with loudest tongue
    Are granted no high place among
    The crowd, shall we be bitter then?
    The puzzle shall grow simple when
    The soul discards the ways of dust.
    There is no gain in doubt; but trust
    Is our one magic wand. Through it
    We and eternity are knit,
    Death made a myth, and darkness lit.
    The slave can meet the monarch’s gaze
    With equal pride, dreaming to days
    When slave and monarch both shall be,
    Transmuted everlastingly,
    A single reed blown on to sing
    The glory of the only King.”

    We had not, in the stealthy gloom
    Of deepening night, that shot our room
    With queerly capering shadows through,
    Noticed the form that wavered to
    And fro on weak, unsteady feet
    Within the door; I turned to greet
    Spring’s gayest cavalier, but Jim
    Who stood there balanced in the dim
    Half-light waved me away from him.
    And then I saw how terror streaked
    His eyes, and how a red flow leaked
    And slid from cheek to chin. His hand
    Still grasped a knotted branch, and spanned
    It fiercely, fondling it. At last
    He moved into the light, and cast
    His eyes about, as if to wrap
    In one soft glance, before the trap
    Was sprung, all he saw mirrored there:
    All love and bounty; grace; all fair,
    All discontented days; sweet weather;
    Rain-slant, snow-fall; all things together
    Which any man about to die
    Might ask to have filmed on his eye,
    And then he bowed his haughty head,
    “The thing we feared has come,” he said;
    “But put your ear down to the ground,
    And you may hear the deadly sound
    Of two-limbed dogs that bay for me.
    If any ask in time to be
    Why I was parted from my breath,
    Here is your tale: I went to death
    Because a man murdered the spring.
    Tell them though they dispute this thing,
    This is the song that dead men sing:
    One spark of spirit God head gave
    To all alike, to sire and slave,
    From earth’s red core to each white pole,
    This one identity of soul;
    That when the pipes of beauty play,
    The feet must dance, the limbs must sway,
    And even the heart with grief turned lead,
    Beauty shall lift like a leaf wind-sped,
    Shall swoop upon in gentle might,
    Shall toss and tease and leave so light
    That never again shall grief or care
    Find long or willing lodgement there.
    Tell them each law and rule they make
    Mankind shall disregard and break
    (If this must be) for beauty’s sake.
    Tell them what pranks the spring can play;
    The young colt leaps, the cat that lay
    In a sullen ball all winter long
    Breaks like a kettle into song;
    Waving it high like a limber flail,
    The kitten worries his own brief tail;
    While man and dog sniff the wind alike,
    For the new smell hurts them like a spike
    Of steel thrust quickly through the breast;
    Earth heaves and groans with a sharp unrest.

    [Illustration]

    The poet, though he sang of death,
    Finds tunes for music in simple breath;
    Even the old, the sleepy-eyed,
    Are stirred to movement by the tide.
    But oh, the young, the aging young,
    Spring is a sweetmeat to our tongue;
    Spring is the pean; we the choir;
    Spring is the fuel; we the fire.
    Tell them spring’s feathery weight will jar,
    Though it were iron, any bar
    Upreared by men to keep apart
    Two who when probed down to the heart
    Speak each a common tongue. Tell them
    Two met, each stooping to the hem
    Of beauty passing by. Such awe
    Grew on them hate began to thaw
    And fear and dread to melt and run
    Like ice laid siege to by the sun.
    Say for a moment’s misty space
    These had forgotten hue and race;
    Spring blew too loud and green a blast
    For them to think on rank and caste.
    The homage they both understood,
    (Taught on a bloody Christless rood)
    Due from his dark to her brighter blood,
    In such an hour, at such a time,
    When all their world was one clear rhyme,
    He could not give, nor she exact.
    This only was a glowing fact:
    Spring in a green and golden gown,
    And feathered feet, had come to town;
    Spring in a rich habiliment
    That shook the breath and woke the spent
    And sleepy pulse to a dervish beat,
    Spring had the world again at her feet.
    Spring was a lady fair and rich,
    And they were fired with the season’s itch
    To hold her train or stroke her hair
    And tell her shyly they found her fair.
    Spring was a voice so high and clear
    It broke their hearts as they leaned to hear
    In stream and grass and soft bird’s-wing;
    Spring was in them and they were spring.
    Then say, a smudge across the day,
    A bit of crass and filthy clay,
    A blot of ink upon a white
    Page in a book of gold; a tight
    Curled worm hid in the festive rose,
    A mind so foul it hurt your nose,
    Came one of earth’s serene elect,
    His righteous being warped and flecked
    With what his thoughts were: stench and smut....
    I had gone on unheeding but
    He struck me down, he called her slut,
    And black man’s mistress, bawdy whore,
    And such like names, and many more,--
    (Christ, what has spring to answer for!)
    I had gone on, I had been wise,
    Knowing my value in those eyes
    That seared me through and out and in,
    Finding a thing to taunt and grin
    At in my hair and hue. My right
    I knew could not outweigh his might
    Who had the law for satellite--
    Only I turned to look at her,
    The early spring’s first worshiper,
    (Spring, what have you to answer for?)
    The blood had fled from either cheek
    And from her lips; she could not speak,
    But she could only stand and stare
    And let her pain stab through the air.
    I think a blow to heart or head
    Had hurt her less than what he said.
    A blow can be so quick and kind,
    But words will feast upon the mind
    And gnaw the heart down to a shred,
    And leave you living, yet leave you dead.
    If he had only tortured me,
    I could have borne it valiantly.
    The things he said in littleness
    Were cheap, the blow he dealt me less,
    Only they totalled more; he gagged
    And bound a spirit there; he dragged
    A sunlit gown of gold and green,--
    (The season’s first, first to be seen)
    And feathered feet, and a plumèd hat,--
    (First of the year to be wondered at)
    Through muck and mire, and by the hair
    He caught a lady rich and fair.
    His vile and puny fingers churned
    Our world about that sang and burned
    A while as never world before.
    He had unlatched an icy door,
    And let the winter in once more.
    To kill a man is a woeful thing,
    But he who lays a hand on spring,
    Clutches the first bird by its throat
    And throttles it in the midst of a note;
    Whose breath upon the leaf-proud tree
    Turns all that wealth to penury;
    Whose touch upon the first shy flower
    Gives it a blight before its hour;
    Whose craven face above a pool
    That otherwise were clear and cool,
    Transforms that running silver dream
    Into a hot and sluggish stream
    Thus better fit to countenance
    His own corrupt unhealthy glance,
    Of all men is most infamous;
    His deed is rank and blasphemous.
    The erstwhile warm, the short time sweet,
    Spring now lay frozen at our feet.
    Say then, why say nothing more
    Except I had to close the door;
    And this man’s leer loomed in the way.
    The air began to sting; then say
    There was this branch; I struck; he fell;
    There’s holiday, I think, in hell.”

    [Illustration]

    Outside the night began to groan
    As heavy feet crushed twig and stone
    Beating a pathway to our door;
    A thin noise first, and then a roar
    More animal than human grew
    Upon the air until we knew
    No mercy could be in the sound.
    “Quick, hide,” I said. I glanced around;
    But no abyss gaped in the ground.
    But in the eyes of fear a twig
    Will seem a tree, a straw as big
    To him who drowns as any raft.
    So being mad, being quite daft,
    I shoved him in a closet set
    Against the wall. This would but let
    Him breathe two minutes more, or three,
    Before they dragged him out to be
    Queer fruit upon some outraged tree.
    Our room was in a moment lit
    With flaring brands; men crowded it--
    Old men whose eyes were better sealed
    In sleep; strong men with muscles steeled
    Like rods, whose place was in the field;
    Striplings like Jim with just a touch
    Of down upon the chin; for such
    More fitting a secluded hedge
    To lie beneath with one to pledge
    In youth’s hot words, immortal love.
    These things they were not thinking of;
    “Lynch him! Lynch him!” O savage cry,
    Why should you echo, “Crucify!”
    One sought, sleek-tongued, to pacify
    Them with slow talk of trial, law,
    Established court; the dripping maw
    Would not be wheedled from its prey.
    Out of the past I heard him say,
    “So be it then; have then your way;
    But not by me shall blood be spilt;
    I wash my hands clean of this guilt.”
    This was an echo of a phrase
    Uttered how many million days
    Gone by?
        Water may cleanse the hands
    But what shall scour the soul that stands
    Accused in heaven’s sight?
                                “The Kid.”
    One cried, “Where is the bastard hid?”
    “He is not here.”
                  It was a faint
    And futile lie.
                  “The hell he ain’t;
    We tracked him here. Show us the place,
    Or else....”
                  He made an ugly face,
    Raising a heavy club to smite.
    I had been felled, had not the sight
    Of all been otherwise arraigned.
    Each with bewilderment unfeigned
    Stared hard to see against the wall
    The hunted boy stand slim and tall;
    Dream-born, it seemed, with just a trace
    Of weariness upon his face,
    He stood as if evolved from air;
    As if always he had stood there....
    What blew the torches’ feeble flare
    To such a soaring fury now?
    Each hand went up to fend each brow,
    Save his; he and the light were one,
    A man by night clad with the sun.
    By form and feature, bearing, name,
    I knew this man. He was the same
    Whom I had thrust, a minute past,
    Behind a door,--and made it fast.
    Knit flesh and bone, had like a thong,
    Bound us as one our whole life long,
    But in the presence of this throng,
    He seemed one I had never known.
    Never such tragic beauty shone
    As this on any face before.
    It pared the heart straight to the core.
    It is the lustre dying lends,
    I thought, to make some brief amends
    To life so wantonly cut down.
    The air about him shaped a crown
    Of light, or so it seemed to me,
    And sweeter than the melody
    Of leaves in rain, and far more sad,
    His voice descended on the mad,
    Blood-sniffing crowd that sought his life,
    A voice where grief cut like a knife:
    “I am he whom you seek, he whom
    You will not spare his daily doom.
    My march is ever to the tomb,
    But let the innocent go free;
    This man and woman, let them be,
    Who loving much have succored me.”
    And then he turned about to speak
    To me whose heart was fit to break,
    “My brother, when this wound has healed,
    And you reap in some other field
    Roses, and all a spring can yield;
    Brother (to call me so!) then prove
    Out of your charity and love
    That I was not unduly slain,
    That this my death was not in vain.
    For no life should go to the tomb
    Unless from it a new life bloom,
    A greater faith, a clearer sight,
    A wiser groping for the light.”
    He moved to where our mother stood,
    Dry-eyed, though grief was at its flood,
    “Mother, not poorer losing one,
    Look now upon your dying son.”
    Her own life trembling on the brim,
    She raised woe-ravaged eyes to him,
    And in their glances something grew
    And spread, till healing fluttered through
    Her pain, a vision so complete
    It sent her humbly to his feet
    With what I deemed a curious cry,
    “And must this be for such as I?”
    Even his captors seemed to feel
    Disquietude, an unrest steal
    Upon their ardor, dampening it,
    Till one less fearful varlet hit
    Him across the mouth a heavy blow,
    Drawing a thin, yet steady flow
    Of red to drip a dirge of slow
    Finality upon my heart.
    The end came fast. Given the start
    One hound must always give the pack
    That fears the meekest prey whose back
    Is desperate against a wall,
    They charged. I saw him stagger, fall
    Beneath a mill of hands, feet, staves.
    And I like one who sees huge waves
    In hunger rise above the skiff
    At sea, yet watching from a cliff
    Far off can lend no feeblest aid,
    No more than can a fragile blade
    Of grass in some far distant land,
    That has no heart to wrench, nor hand
    To stretch in vain, could only stand
    With streaming eyes and watch the play.
    There grew a tree a little way
    Off from the hut, a virgin tree
    Awaiting its fecundity.
    _O Tree was ever worthier Groom
    Led to a bride of such rare bloom?
    Did ever fiercer hands enlace
    Love and Beloved in an embrace
    As heaven-smiled-upon as this?
    Was ever more celestial kiss?
    But once, did ever anywhere
    So full a choir chant such an air
    As feathered splendors bugled there?
    And was there ever blinder eye
    Or deafer ear than mine?_
                              A cry
    So soft, and yet so brimming filled
    With agony, my heart strings thrilled
    An ineffectual reply,--
    Then gaunt against the southern sky
    The silent handiwork of hate.
    Greet, Virgin Tree, your holy mate!

    [Illustration]

    No sound then in the little room
    Was filtered through my sieve of gloom,
    Except the steady fall of tears,
    The hot, insistent rain that sears
    The burning ruts down which it goes,
    The futile flow, for all one knows
    How vain it is, that ever flows.
    I could not bear to look at _her_
    There in the dark; I could not stir
    From where I sat, so weighted down.
    The king of grief, I held my crown
    So dear, I wore my tattered gown
    With such affection and such love
    That though I strove I could not move.
    But I could hear (and this unchained
    The raging beast in me) her pained
    And sorrow-riven voice ring out
    Above the spirit’s awful rout,
    Above the howling winds of doubt,
    How she knew Whom she traveled to
    Was judge of all that men might do
    To such as she who trusted Him.
    Faith was a tower for her, grim
    And insurmountable; and death
    She said was only changing breath
    Into an essence fine and rare.
    Anger smote me and most despair
    Seeing her still bow down in prayer.
    “Call on Him now,” I mocked, “and try
    Your faith against His deed, while I
    With intent equally as sane,
    Searching a motive for this pain,
    Will hold a little stone on high
    And seek of it the reason why.
    Which, stone or God, will first reply?
    Why? Hear me ask it. He was young
    And beautiful. Why was he flung
    Like common dirt to death? Why, stone,
    Must he of all the earth atone
    For what? The dirt God used was homely
    But the man He made was comely.
    What child creating out of sand,
    With puckered brow and intent hand,
    Would see the lovely thing he planned
    Struck with a lewd and wanton blade,
    Nor stretch a hand to what he made,
    Nor shed a childish, futile tear,
    Because he loved it, held it dear?
    Would not a child’s weak heart rebel?
    But Christ who conquered Death and Hell
    What has He done for you who spent
    A bleeding life for His content?
    Or is the white Christ, too, distraught
    By these dark sins His Father wrought?”

    [Illustration]

    I mocked her so until I broke
    Beneath my passion’s heavy yoke.
    My world went black with grief and pain:
    My very bitterness was slain,
    And I had need of only sleep,
    Or some dim place where I might weep
    My life away, some misty haunt
    Where never man might come to taunt
    Me with the thought of how men scar
    Their brothers here, or what we are
    Upon this most accursèd star.
    Not that sweet sleep from which some wake
    All fetterless, without an ache
    Of heart or limb, but such a sleep
    As had raped him, eternal, deep;--
    Deep as my woe, vast as my pain,
    Sleep of the young and early-slain.
    My Lycidas was dead. There swung
    In all his glory, lusty, young,
    My Jonathan, my Patrocles,
    (For with his death there perished these)
    And I had neither sword nor song,
    Only an acid-bitten tongue,
    Fit neither in its poverty
    For vengeance nor for threnody,
    Only for tears and blasphemy.

    Now God be praised that a door should creak,
    And that a rusty hinge should shriek.
    Of all sweet sounds that I may hear
    Of lute or lyre or dulcimer,
    None ever shall assail my ear
    Sweet as the sound of a grating door
    I had thought closed forevermore.
    Out of my deep-ploughed agony,
    I turned to see a door swing free;
    The very door he once came through
    To death, now framed for us anew
    His vital self, his and no other’s
    Live body of the dead, my brother’s.
    Like one who dreams within a dream,
    Hand at my throat, lest I should scream,
    I moved with hopeful, doubting pace
    To meet the dead man face to face.

    “Bear witness now unto His grace”;
    I heard my mother’s mounting word,
    “Behold the glory of the Lord,
    His unimpeachable high seal.
    Cry mercy now before Him; kneel,
    And let your heart’s conversion swell
    The wonder of His miracle.”

    I saw; I touched; yet doubted him;
    My fingers faltered down his slim
    Sides, down his breathing length of limb.
    Incredulous of sight and touch,
    “No more,” I cried, “this is too much
    For one mad brain to stagger through.”
    For there he stood in utmost view
    Whose death I had been witness to;
    But now he breathed; he lived; he walked;
    His tongue could speak my name; he talked.
    He questioned me to know what art
    Had made his enemies depart.
    Either I leaped or crawled to where
    I last had seen stiff on the air
    The form than life more dear to me;
    But where had swayed that misery
    Now only was a flowering tree
    That soon would travail into fruit.
    Slowly my mind released its mute
    Bewilderment, while truth took root
    In me and blossomed into light:
    “Down, down,” I cried, in joy and fright,
    As all He said came back to me
    With what its true import must be,
    “Upon our knees and let the worst,
    Let me the sinfullest kneel first;
    O lovely Head to dust brought low
    More times than we can ever know
    Whose small regard, dust-ridden eye,
    Behold Your doom, yet doubt You die;
    O Form immaculately born,
    Betrayed a thousand times each morn,
    As many times each night denied,
    Surrendered, tortured, crucified!
    Now have we seen beyond degree
    That love which has no boundary;
    Our eyes have looked on Calvary.”

    No sound then in the sacred gloom
    That blessed the shrine that was our room
    Except the steady rise of praise
    To Him who shapes all nights and days
    Into one final burst of sun;
    Though with the praise some tears must run
    In pity of the King’s dear breath
    That ransomed one of us from death.

    The days are mellow for us now;
    We reap full fields; the heavy bough
    Bends to us in another land;
    The ripe fruit falls into our hand.
    My mother, Job’s dark sister, sits
    Now in a corner, prays, and knits.
    Often across her face there flits
    Remembered pain, to mar her joy,
    At Whose death gave her back her boy.
    While I who mouthed my blasphemies,
    Recalling now His agonies,
    Am found forever on my knees,
    Ever to praise her Christ with her,
    Knowing He can at will confer
    Magic on miracle to prove
    And try me when I doubt His love.
    If I am blind He does not see;
    If I am lame He halts with me;
    There is no hood of pain I wear
    That has not rested on His hair
    Making Him first initiate
    Beneath its harsh and hairy weight.
    He grew with me within the womb;
    He will receive me at the tomb.
    He will make plain the misty path
    He makes me tread in love and wrath,
    And bending down in peace and grace
    May wear again my brother’s face.

    Somewhere the Southland rears a tree,
    (And many others there may be
    Like unto it, that are unknown,
    Whereon as costly fruit has grown).
    It stands before a hut of wood
    In which the Christ Himself once stood--
    And those who pass it by may see
    Nought growing there except a tree,
    But there are two to testify
    Who hung on it ... we saw Him die.
    Its roots were fed with priceless blood.
    It is the Cross; it is the Rood.

                      Paris, January 31, 1929.

1.F.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
